Problem 1
(b)
There would be two instances: one memory space for the parent and one for the child.
When fork() is called, a copy of the parent is made for the child but the child has it's own memory space.


Problem 2
a) variables i and x are global variables and can be accessed by all methods.
   variables pid, j and y are local variables and are only available to the main method.
b) 
(1)Since child initially sees what the parent sees, I can safely assume that the data and stack segment were copied over to child.
(2) Changes made by the child can't be seen by the parent so, this shows they don't access the same memory space.

d)
1. Yes.I closed the parent process and the child process was still able to read from the file.
2.Yes. When I tried to read more from the file into the parent the letters were muddled up which shows the child reading was affecting it.
