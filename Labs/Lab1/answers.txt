(1.1) Home directory
/home/accounts/student/i/ia005

(2.1) A version control system is a type of system that keeps track of changes in files and allows for retrieval of different versions of these files.
(2.2)
i. Local Version Control Systems: This would be useful to a single programmer working on a project and has no network access since it's simple and present on the programmer's hard disk.
ii. Centralized Version Control Systems: This would be useful to a group of programmers working on a project. Each of them would be able to access all versions of the project from a remote  server. 
iii. Distributed Version Control Systems: This would be useful to a group of programmers without ample access to a centralized server.
(2.3) Distributed Version Control System(DVCS)
(2.4)Performing operations in Git locally means Git doesn't depend heavily on remote servers. It is able to access the local hard disk for information it needs to generate the right version it is asked.
i. Network connection not required to access versions of project.
ii. Network connection not required to do extra work on project.
(2.5)Git thinks of its objects as a set of snapshots of a filesystem. Once an object is committed, a snapshot is taken of the object. A reference is created to each snapshot. 
(2.6) The three states a file can be include the modified state, the staged state and the committed state.
In the modified state, the user makes changes to a file but this changes are not saved yet and are not accessible to other users. It's present only on the user'slocal directory.
In the staged state, a file is in the staging area and has been selected to be added to the database of the Git directory(committed).
In the committed state, the changed version of the file is stored in the database of the Git directory and can be accessed by everyone on the project.

(3.1) Bytecodes is the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine. It is generated when a java compiler compiles the java source code written in an editor by a programmer.
(3.2) A benefit is portabity(write once, run anywhere).
(3.3) Using the JVM means the program runs a little slower than executing the code directly on the hardware.
(3.4)I believe most of it.
i. Learning of a new programming language is pretty easy with fore-knowledge of other programming languages. It's even better if it's C or C++ because they have similar layout and Java was developed from C.
ii. Compared to C++, Java may require less code but compared to another high level language, Python, this is not the case.
iii. The concept of reusable code is phenomenal and so, makes writing code better since I can use for example, a class from a previous program that performs a function I require in my new program.
iv. While Java may allow devoloping code quickly compared to C++, it doesn't mean the code runs faster.
v. Avoiding platform dependency is good because it means a wider range of audience is reached without much work.
vi. Once JVM is present on a computer, any java code written from any platform can be run on a such a computer.
vii. If the Web Start software does what's wriitten above, then software distribution is indeed easy.
(3.5)i. /*text*/
     ii. /**documentation */
     iii. //text
(3.6)i. Make sure MyProgram.java is in the directory with the same name as the name of the package in the program.
ii. Compile the code with a compiler e.g javac
	$javac packageName/MyProgram.java
iii. Run the bytecode created(without the .java extension).
	$java packageName.MyProgram

(4.1) 
public void println(String x)
Prints a String and then terminate the line. This method behaves as though it invokes print(String) and then println().
Parameters:
x - The String to be printed.
(4.2)standard input stream: in
     type: InputStream

(5.1)In java, the data type of the result of a numerical expression is dependent on the data type of the operands. In this snippet, the data type is integer so,the decimal portion of the result is cut off and the integer portion returned as the final result.
(5.2) My output is 1.0.
In java, the data type of the answer is dependent on the data type of the operands. Since the data types of x and y is int. The answer is returned as an integer(1) but since this integer would be stored in a "double" variable, the answer(1) would be returned as a double (1.0) .

(6.1) The args variable is a String array with elements and this elements are initialized to command line arguments.
(6.2) shows the method would not be returning anything.
(6.3)An identifier is any word used to represent a variable, method or class.
i. Should not be same as any java keyword.
ii. Can contain a lower case or upper case letter, numbers, underscore and the dollar sign.
iii. Can't start with a number.
iv. Can be any length.
(6.4) A keyword is a special word with a special meaning in java. 
(6.5) A float and double variable store decimal numbers. A double variable can have twice as much significant digits as a float variable.
(6.6) byte, short, int, and long variables store integers. byte stores in 1 byte. short stores in 2 bytes. int stores in 4 bytes. long stores in 8 bytes. 
(6.7) No. String data type is a class.
(6.8) String name = "Dunni Adenuga";
(6.9) Scope of a variable means the lifetime of a variable. The variable meaning is limited to within the curly brackets where the variable is initialized.
