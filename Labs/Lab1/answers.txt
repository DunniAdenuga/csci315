Problem 1
(b)
There would be two instances: one memory space for the parent and one for the child.
When fork() is called, a copy of the parent is made for the child but the child has it's own memory space.

Problem 2
a) variables i and x are global variables and can be accessed by all methods.
   variables pid, j and y are local variables and are only available to the main method.
b) 
(1)Since child initially sees what the parent sees, I can safely assume that the data and stack segment were copied over to child.
(2) Changes made by the child can't be seen by the parent so, this shows they don't access the same memory space.



/*
Definition of Stack Memory Segment. The stack memory segment is an area of memory allotted for automatic variables. Automatic variables are allocated and de-allocated automatically when program flow enters and leaves the variable's scope.
*/

/*
In computing, a data segment (often denoted .data) is a portion of an object file or the corresponding virtual address space of a program that contains initialized static variables, that is, global variables and static local variables.
