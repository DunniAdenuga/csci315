1. Two different processes aree communicating. They're reading and writing to each other without resorting to shared variables. A communication link is also established using sockets. fork() is not the only system call for IPC.

2.socket() is a functionality provided by the kernel. First clue is that it's located in the System Calls section of the linux manual.
It would make more sense to make it a kernel functionality since more advanced priviledges and hardware resources are needed for network connections. It wouldbe better to make a system call than have to be a library function and have to change to kernel mode every time.

3. i. Capacity- buffer holds enough bytes before other process receives.
ii Synchronization-Message gets sent and received in correct order .
ii.Directionality- bidirectional quality. We can send, receive on one side and on the other.
iv. Reliability- Anything sent gets received.

4. gethostbyname() returns a structure of type hostent for the given host name. It performs a lookup on the given host name. It gives information like the official name of host, alias list, host address type and length of address for an host name. 

5. getaddrinfo() would be used.
It stores the lookup information into structs specifiedin its argument.
It returns more information.
No dependency on IPv4 orIPV6.
