Lab3 feedback for Adenuga, Dunni (ia005)

prelab1: In your pre-lab.txt file jot down your observations regarding the following:

  1. Do the threads order of execution match the order in which they were created?
  2. Looking at the characters that a printed to the standard output, do the threads always follow the same order of execution? That is, we want to know whether if you always see thread 1, then thread 2, then thread 3, etc., repeating in a predictable order
	Score: 19 / 20
	Comment: -1: first answer could be more clear, when you say they run concurrently, what does that mean for the order of execution? - they run in a random order

prelab2: Write a program called mytime.c, which calls gettimeofday(2), passes the
results to ctime(3), and then prints to the screen the resulting string.
Whether you have used these functions before or not, take the time to read
their man pages to understand what they do and how to use them.
