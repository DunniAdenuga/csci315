Lab6 feedback for Adenuga, Dunni (ia005)
------------------------------------------------------------
pre1a: * Correct comments for the lines marked as ADD COMMENT HERE.
  * All functions use wrappers.
  * Redefined MYPORT above 8000.
  * write the code for a new function called printsin() according to the specifications below, uncomment the calls to printsin in recv_udp.c and build the executable.

prea1b: 1. Two functions used in these programs are of particular interest to you: recvfrom and sendto. Read their man pages to understand what these functions do. Write in your file pre-lab.txt a brief explanation of what you learned about these functions from the man pages.
  2. In pre-lab.txt, write a brief explanation about how different it is to work with UDP and TCP sockets. Use and cite your favorite sources.

problem2: 1. Adapt your Makefile so that it builds the executables that correspond to your new C files.
  2. Modify your multithreaded client/server to create a new implementation that uses UDP sockets instead of TCP sockets.
  3. When you are confident that you have debugged your code, create a text file called output2.txt with the record of a few sample runs of ugetfile and ugetstats for your threaded application. What you record in this file must be enough to demonstrate that your programs work correctly.
