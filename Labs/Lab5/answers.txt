1. Explain why rand_r is thread safe ?
Unlike rand(), rand_r() is thread safe since it does not use a hidden internal state(buffer) which could be overwritten when each thread calls it and could even be used as seed for the next call instead, the user names the exact state to be used when  a function calls it.
