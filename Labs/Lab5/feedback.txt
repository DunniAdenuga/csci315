Lab5 feedback for Adenuga, Dunni (ia005)

perlab1: In circular-list.c, flesh out the implementation of the functions for
insertion and removal in the ADT. Create program src/adt-test.c, where you
will write tests to call all the three functions in the ADT. The goal of this
program is to exercise your implementation so that you can discover any bugs
and, subsequently, correct them. Modify the Makefile given to you so that it
compiles src/adt-test.c and places the executable in directory bin/.

perlab2: 1. Describe succintly the difference between mutex and semaphore.
  2. Write a couple of sentences to describe each of the six calls 
    1. pthread_mutex_init
    2. pthread_mutex_lock
    3. pthread_mutex_unlock
    4. sem_init(3)
    5. sem_wait(3)
    6. sem_post(3)

problem 2: flesh out the functions that model producer and consumer threads. Work with
the code to verify that the numbers being generated to pass into usleep do
look random â€“ you will have to restructure calls to rand_r so that you can
print the values to standard out for inspection.
	Score: 10 / 10
problem 3: Create a file called answers.txt in which you explain why rand_r is thread
safe.
	Score: 10 / 10
problem 5: Finally, flesh out the main() function in prodcons.c to bring everything
together. Your main() will read three command line parameters, all integers,
provided as in the example below. If the user tries to invoke your program
without these three parameters, your program should: (a) display a help
message indicating the correct usage (hint: use the structure in the example
below) and (b) exit with (-1) termination status.
