I have 3 additional functions.

/*
It finds the smallest space available that is bigger than the required size
->iterate through free-list
->find required node
*/
allocateBestFit(size);

/*
It finds the biggest space availablein free-list that is bigger than the required size
->iterate through free-list
->find required node
*/
allocateWorstFit(size);

/*
It finds the first space available that is bigger than the required size
->iterate through free-list
->find required node
*/
allocateFirstFit(size);
