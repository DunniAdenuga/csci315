1.open(2)
-Get current directory from hard-disk(secondary structure)
-Place in memory
-Find file if it exists, get file control block from secondary storage
-Return file descriptor 
The argument is the path name for file, so it can search for the file in the current directory or directory specified in pathname.

read(2)
The argument is the file descriptor returned by open, a buffer to store what's read and count, number of bytes to be read from file.
-Checks for file descriptor in open file table which has a ponter to a system wide open file table that contains the file control block of files open by processes in the system..
-The FCB has details about file location, size, permissions etc so we can now read it from the the secondary storage.


2. If a system-wide file table is kept, it would help avoid redundancy. If a process already has a file open, no need for another process to open another copy.

3. It is useful. Memory is volatile, once a computer is off, memory is wiped clean. Having a secondary storage ensures we have a stable copy of the file and it can still be accessed.
